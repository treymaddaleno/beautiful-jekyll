<b> Hey! I'm Trey Maddaleno. </b>
<p> I'm a junior chemistry major at Truman State University in Kirksville, MO. Right now, I'm especially interested in computational methods and exploring other techniques in environmental chemistry and astrochemistry. Below is a photo of me presenting the research I performed as part of an REU in <a href="https://fabiengoulay.faculty.wvu.edu/">the Goulay Lab at WVU</a> in Summer 2019. Check out my resume or keep up with me via email, Twitter, or even my LinkedIn. </p>
